                <p>In 1995 my mother bought our first family computer. I didn't know any better so I
                    figured it was a
                    vending machine... Yup, I stuck nickels and quarters in the floppy drive. After expressing my
                    frustrations of not getting my soda my mother bought a book on hardware repair. My
                    technological journey had just begun.
                    <span class="underline--magical">Growing up I focused a lot on design within Photoshop and

                    sales. I later got a job at the headquarters of 2nd largest telecommunications broker in the
                    United States. Having won countless awards for my performance I was at the top of the world. I
                    started getting offers for positions exclusively as a sales manager/trainer but there was just one

                    <p>I find myself pretty lucky to have been taught web-development during the transition period
                        somewhere between ES5 and ES6 in regards to javascript. With the use of const, let, blocked
                        scope, template strings, arrow functions, and a plethora of other new features ES6 is
                        introducing I'm positive that my workflow through the use of improved shorthand will guide my
                        workflow tremendously. Speaking of workflow I am going to start implementing aliases for all
                        boilerplate and repetitive sequence operations as I've heard it can improve a developers
                        productivity on an average of 75%. WOW! That is an considerably significant increase. When
                        paired in conjunction of a 2nd monitor I'm certain most initialization and boilerplate
                        operations will be an absolute breeze.</p>

                    <p>
                        Lastly I'd like to talk about my work in developing a trading bot for the crypto market. Before
                        learn web development I spend about 5 months learning a language called Pinescript. You can see
                        the documentation on it <span><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/study-script-reference/">here</a></span>.
                        It was made by the good people over at TradingView and has proven to be a very effective tool
                        at creating a boilerplate for trading strategies. It however has a flaw. I've discovered that
                        when stacked up against live or simulated testing it doesn't fare the same results. This is
                        because simulated back-testing done through TradingView shows would be trades based on
                        historical graphs and pricing. For it to be more effective they would need to implement
                        back-testing based on a play-by-play of the growth of the candles body and wicks whether they
                        be up or down.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The trouble is that a strategy might trigger on the close of a candle with relation to price
                        action and looking at prior data it is sometimes difficult to determine whether the close ever
                        crossed a given threshold and it could revert back to a point above or below once the candle is
                        finished. This is why a live log of live trade data is best when conducting back-testing.
                        Essentially what I am building is a live replay of trade data with respect to price action
                        second-by-second in relation to volume. This will allow be to test strategies in a matter of
                        seconds versus waiting weeks to see a final outcome which is going to save me and my future
                        clients a HUGE amount of time money otherwise spent on testing. It's not a final solution as to
                        say that live testing with real funds is the sure way to go but no other platform offers this
                        feature. I can't wait to release it!
