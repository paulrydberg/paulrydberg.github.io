Unoccupied attic and garden level spaces with good ceiling height for duplexing if purchaser chooses. Owners have never had water in the basement since 2003. This is the perfect location to take advantage of all public transportation (both Metra and CTA), Avondale nightlife and restaurants, grocery stores, and gyms. Tremendous upside for more income due to very long term tenants. Newer siding, roof, windows, gutters, and downspouts. Some mechanicals have been updated. Central boiler is working fine but is old.
