Avondale 2-flat - Very well maintained and updated legal 2-flat being sold by long time owners. This is a wide building on a wide lot, with a very nice front and back yard and a two car garage. Unoccupied attic and garden level spaces with good ceiling height for duplexing if purchaser chooses. Owners have never had water in the basement since 2003. This is the perfect location to take advantage of all public transportation (both Metra and CTA), Avondale nightlife and restaurants, grocery stores, and gyms. Tremendous upside for more income due to very long term tenants. Newer siding, roof, windows, gutters, and downspouts. Some mechanicals have been updated. Central boiler is working fine but is old. See notes in Agent Remarks section for showing availability and offer instructions. This is not a distressed sale, just a very well-priced offering looking for great offers with great purchase terms.",0,,Matt Shrake,3129815500,900618.lead.lag.100021502@leads.leadrouter.com,375000,United States,,09958452,05/20/2018,,,,Multi Family,0,0,0,0,0,0,false,,,d80f453f256c5cb,unset,unset,,,false,Matt,Shrake,900618.lead.lag.100021502@leads.leadrouter.com,"","","",,United States,,,,,,,United States,,(312) 981-5500,"",Matt Shrake,900618.lead.lag.100021502@leads.leadrouter.com,"",(312) 981-5500,Matt Shrake,900618.lead.lag.100021502@leads.leadrouter.com,(312) 981-5500,"",""

Aliso Viejo is known for its proximity to the beach towns, available entertainment and accessibility to freeways and airports for easy travel, this is a place you’ll not want to miss. Enter through a gated front patio to this cute end unit location. Notice the open floor plan immediately upon entry. The entire first floor is dedicated to the kitchen and social space with a sizeable living and dining area. The kitchen included a side by side washer and dryer with extra storage space. Also, the light and bright colors make the kitchen feel open and looks out to the front patio. At the back of the family room is a large sliding door that opens to a private patio. Of course, the community courtyard in the back is easily accessible through the patio gate. Back inside, as you head toward the stairs, notice the ample closet space located underneath and the half bath on your way up. Upstairs, off the front of the house there are two secondary rooms. They look out over the community with no one directly across from the unit, so they are private. The full bathroom upstairs is located just down the hall and connects to the master bedroom. One can’t miss the high ceilings that open the room right up. The master also provides a large closet and a private balcony that overlooks the community courtyard. This property is freshly painted, has new doors and closet doors throughout, new toilets, new carpet and includes a carport and additional assigned parking space.",0,,Sueann Challita,9492820088,sueannchallita@gmail.com,440000,United States,,OC18114911,05/15/2018,,,,Single Family,0,0,0,0,0,0,false,,,f7211875acc78c5,unset,unset,,,false,Sueann,Challita,sueannchallita@gmail.com,27101 Puerta Real #150,Mission Viejo,CA,92691,United States,,,,,,,United States,,(949) 282-0088,"",Sueann Challita,sueannchallita@gmail.com,"",(949) 282-0088,Sueann Challita,sueannchallita@gmail.com,(949) 282-0088,"","27101 Puerta Real #150 Mission Viejo, California 92691"

A once in a lifetime offering in an incomparable setting, Opie's Grist Mill is a home that needs to be seen to be believed! Converted into a residence in the mid-1960's incorporating the original mechanicals, this historic mill was owned by the president of the Van Harlingen Historical Society and was truly a labor of love. Pike Brook winds its way along the property, flowing into a waterfall right below the deck. Rooms are enveloped by the sights and sounds of the cascading waters. The living room features original beams and wood floors with a fireplace. A charming kitchen was renovated in the 1990's and sits alongside a cozy breakfast nook, where laundry is cleverly tucked out of sight. The family room and dining room open right out to the deck. Both bathrooms and the powder room were updated and most floors refinished. A loft-style landing leads to 3 spacious bedrooms, two of which connect directly to bathrooms.

Experience the joy of country living in this lovely Appalachian-style log home. Set on a beautifully landscaped 3-acre corner lot, this exquisite 1,942 sq. ft., 3 bedroom, 2 bath cabin is bursting with rustic charm. Spend lazy summer evenings relaxing on the front porch overlooking the spacious front yard, or listen to the bubbling fountain in the koi pond as you unwind on the secluded fenced-in patio in the rear. Open a few of the many windows for a breath of fresh air! In the winter, come in from the cold to the welcoming warmth of the wood burning stove. The 4-sided ledgestone chimney that runs to the top of the cathedral ceiling compliments the interior log walls and exposed ceiling beams present in all of the rooms. A balcony at the top of the staircase overlooks the comfortable living room. A large, separate family room provides space for entertaining those extra guests. The cozy kitchen boasts a breakfast bar and granite countertops, and is adjacent to the formal dining room. The bathrooms provide both a full tub/shower and a shower stall for convenience and variety. A full basement provides plenty of storage space as do the roomy closets. Included on the property is a matching detached 2-car garage with an attic for even more storage space and a sturdy wood and tool shed. A wide circular driveway completes the rustic look. This comfortable, welcoming abode is tucked away in a quiet, scenic neighborhood on Coppermine Road, and is ideally located just minutes from Princeton offering cultural events, shopping, restaurants, family activities, corporate outings and filled with abundant amenities within an hour of two major metropolitan areas, N.Y.C and Philadelphia.
