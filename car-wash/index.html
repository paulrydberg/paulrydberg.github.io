          SUBJECT: Something of interest?
        </p>
        <p>
          Hi "prospect's first name",
        </p>
        <p>
          I was in your lobby the other day and noticed you had a customer ready
          to go. I was particularly interested in your work on selling in high
          volumes.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm reaching out because I see a fantastic way for me to help you make
          more money selling the same amount of cars each month. You could make
          up to double your sales commissions.
        </p>

        <p>
          In fact, the data shows that customers like your average american
          spends over $1500 on professional car wash memberships.
        </p>

        <p>
          You could almost double your commissions checks overnight if you made
          an extra $200 per car! It costs the customer an extra $600, they get a
          car wash whenever they want so long as they don't sell the car. For 15
          minutes with your GM you could be making almost double…
        </p>

        <p>
          I don’t have much else to say other than I wish you the best of luck
          and don’t be jealous when the salespeople at the other dealerships
          make double what you make.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm not at all trying to upset you and am just being honest when I
          tell you that instead of making what you make now each month you could
          easily be making up to
          <span id="showcase"> <strong>DOUBLE</strong></span> instead by selling
          the same number of cars each month. Think about it or just give me a
          call.
        </p>

        <p>
          PS - If you aren't the right person to contact about this, let me
          know. If you would prefer I not follow-up with you, you can let me
          know that too!
